		<div class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mandi system, farmers get a very low
share of the rupee due to a long chain of
intermediaries and cartelization at the
physical marketplace, which adds two major
costs: the intermediaries margins as well as
multiple handling costs.
Further, due to the current pandemic   
situationit is highly appreciated to
avoid long chain of intermediaries to
avoid spread of virus. Also, gathering of
large crowd in mandi is very unsafe.
Therefore, the aim is to provide farmers a India
portal for sale and purchase of agricultural
produce, in an efficient and transparent
manner.
will become a more safer option for both
the seller and the buyer during this pandemic.<br>
<h3><font color="green"> How can this idea make India Atmanirbhar ?</font></h3>

 *This E-Marketing platform will
 reduce the role
 of middlemen who are
 hindering the trading sector
 in the agriculture.<br><br>
 *Now the farmers will be able
 to directly deal with their
 buyers without depending
 on mandis. Ultimately
 farmers will be &nbsp;more
 dependent and will make
 maximum profit.<br><br>
 *An end user can browse
 through various commodity
 category and states
 category. This will havea
 simple flow to reach<br> &nbsp;the
 selected commodities
 mandi price making it user
 friendly.
