		<h3>WHEAT</h3>
		<font color="black"><p>Wheat is a highly-nutritional and widely-cultivated cereal grain.
		 For over 7 centuries, wheat has been raised and harvested in many countries around the world.
		It’s one of the world’s most important crops and holds the title of the second most produced grain in the world, beaten only by corn. 
		Over 750 million metric tons of wheat were produced in 2017/18 worldwide.
It is the most important cereal crop in the north and north-western parts of the country. 
It is a rabi crop that requires 50-75 cm of annual rainfall.
India is the second-largest producer of wheat in the world. 
It is highly dependent on this rabi crop for its agricultural income. 
Wheat is a staple food among Indians, especially in the northern regions.
Wheat requires cool temperatures during its growing season in the range of about 14°c to 18°c. 
Rainfall of about 50 cms to 90 cms is most ideal. However, during harvesting season in the spring, wheat requires
 bright sunshine and slightly warmer weather. 
Uttar Pradesh is the largest wheat-growing state in India closely followed by Punjab and Haryana.</p>

	<h3>RICE</h3>
		<font color="black"><p>It is the staple food crop in a majority of regions in the country. 
Rice is a Kharif crop that requires high temperature, heavy rainfall and high humidity for proper growth. 
The areas with less rainfall use irrigation for rice cultivation.
India is the second-largest producer of rice in the world after China. 
India accounts for approximately 20% of the worlds rice production. 
It is arguably the most important agricultural crop that grows in the country. 
Rice is a staple food pan India, and its cultivation is also widespread across the country.
Rice prominently grows in high rainfall areas. 
It requires average temperatures of 25°c and a minimum of 100 cms of rainfall. 
It’s traditionally grown in waterlogged rice paddy fields. 
Northeast plains and coastal areas are the major rice-producing areas of the country.</p>

		<h3>MOONG</h3>
		<font color="black"><p>Green gram or moong (Phaseolus aureus Roxb) is important pulse crops. The grains (whole or split) are used as a pulse or made into flour, and into straw and husk as fodder for cattle. Grains are also eaten whole (after germinating them), parched, salted, with sugar or boiled with condiments. The important states producing this pulse are Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
The crop needs a well-distributed rainfall. Heavy rains at flowering are harmful, even moist winds at this stage interfere with fertilization.
This pulse does best on deep, well-drained loams in the alluvial tract in the north as well as on the red and black soils of peninsular and southern India. It is also cultivated on light or shallow stony soils to clayey soils.
For the pure crop in the kharif season, the land is ploughed once or twice and harrowed to obtain a rough tilth. The summer crop can be sown dry in furrows in between the rows of the previous crop, followed by irrigation.</p>

 animal feed, malt products and human food.
The barley crop is grown in around 70 million hectares of land across the world. 
Global production stands around 160 million tons. In the world, Europe is the most leading continent growing Barley followed by Asia.

Soybean has become an important oilseed crop in India in a very short period with approximately 10-million ha area under its cultivation. India is divided into five agro-climatic zones for soybean cultivation. These are northern hill zone, northern plain zone, north eastern zone, central zone, and southern zone. There are specific varieties released for each zone which are suited to their agro-climatic conditions.The major soybean growing states are Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Chattisgarh.The crop can be grown in most parts of India, and states like northeast states, Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand, have good potential of soybean.</p>
