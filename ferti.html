		<h3>NITROGEN FERTILIZERS</h3>
		<font color="black"><p>Nitrogen fertilizers are made from ammonia (NH3) produced by the Haber-Bosch process.In this energy-intensive process, natural gas (CH4) usually supplies the hydrogen, and the nitrogen (N2) is derived from the air. This ammonia is used as a feedstock for all other nitrogen fertilizers,
 such as anhydrous ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and urea (CO(NH2)2).
Deposits of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (Chilean saltpeter) are also found in the Atacama desert in Chile and was one of the original (1830) nitrogen-rich fertilizers used.It is still mined for fertilizer.Nitrates are also produced from ammonia by the Ostwald process.</p>

	<h3>PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS</h3>
		<font color="black"><p>All phosphate fertilizers are obtained by extraction from minerals containing the anion PO43−. 
In rare cases, fields are treated with the crushed mineral, but most often more soluble salts are produced by chemical treatment of phosphate minerals. 
The most popular phosphate-containing minerals are referred to collectively as phosphate rock. The main minerals are fluorapatite Ca5(PO4)3F (CFA) and 
hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH. These minerals are converted to water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with sulfuric (H2SO4) or phosphoric acids (H3PO4). 
The large production of sulfuric acid as an industrial chemical is primarily due to its use as cheap acid in processing phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizer.
 The global primary uses for both sulfur and phosphorus compounds relate to this basic process.
In the nitrophosphate process or Odda process, phosphate rock with up to a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with nitric acid (HNO3) 
to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2). 
This mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a compound fertilizer with the three macronutrients N, P and K in easily dissolved form.</p>

		<h3>POTASSIUM FERTILIZERS</h3>
		<font color="black"><p>Potash is a mixture of potassium minerals used to make potassium (chemical symbol: K) fertilizers. Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps; e.g., to remove sodium chloride (NaCl) (common salt). Sometimes potash is referred to as K2O, as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content. In fact, potash fertilizers are usually potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium carbonate, or potassium nitrate.</p>

		<h3>COMPOUND FERTILIZERS</h3>
		<font color="black"><p>Compound fertilizers, which contain N, P, and K, can often be produced by mixing straight fertilizers. In some cases, chemical reactions occur between the two or more components. For example, monoammonium and diammonium phosphates, which provide plants with both N and P, are produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid (from phosphate rock) and ammonia :
<p>NH3 + H3PO4 → (NH4)H2PO4</p>
<p>2 NH3 + H3PO4 → (NH4)2HPO4</p>

		<h3>ORGANIC FERTILIZERS</h3>
	<font color="black"><p>Organic fertilizers are fertilizers derived from animal matter, animal excreta (manure), human excreta, and vegetable matter (e.g. compost and crop residues).Naturally occurring organic fertilizers include animal wastes from meat processing, peat, manure, slurry, and guano.
	In contrast, the majority of fertilizers used in commercial farming are extracted from minerals (e.g., phosphate rock) or produced industrially (e.g., ammonia). Organic agriculture, a system of farming, allows for certain fertilizers and amendments and disallows others; that is also distinct from this topic.
